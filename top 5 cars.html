     1.<U>ROlls-ROYCE PANTHOM </U>
</h2>
<P>
    <li> The grandest and greatest luxury conveyance in motordom was replaced by Rolls-Royce in 2017 and given a glittering five-star road test <br> welcome by our road testers shortly thereafter.</li>
</P>
<p>
   <li> Owners will love it at least as much for the extravagant statement of wealth and status it endows and for the unmatched sense of occasion <br> you enjoy when travelling in one. But, while many won’t ever know as much, the latest Phantom is also an utter joy and a rare pleasure to <br> drive.</li>
</p>
<p>
   <li> Its superbly comfortable and singularly isolating ride comfort can be sampled from the back seats, of course, and is like nothing else <br> you’ll encounter in a car: gently loping and deliciously indulgent-feeling but also supremely quiet and smooth, despite Rolls-Royce's fitment <br> of the latest run-flat tyre technology.</li>
</p>
<p><li> Yet the precision feel and perfect weight of the car’s large-rimmed steering wheel is remarkable, likewise the ease with which you can <br> place such a huge car on the road; the tolerance it has for whatever rate of progress suits your trip; the supreme refinement and flexibility of <br> its V12 engine; and the progressiveness of its throttle pedal on step-off.
